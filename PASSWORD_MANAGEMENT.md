# Password Management in Admin Panel

## Overview
The admin panel now displays passwords for teachers and students to help administrators manage user accounts and provide login credentials to users.

## Features

### Password Display
- **Hidden by Default**: Passwords are shown as dots (••••••••) for security
- **Show/Hide Toggle**: Click "Show" to reveal the actual password, "Hide" to conceal it
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Click "Copy" to copy the password to clipboard for easy sharing

### Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Access Control**: Only administrators can view passwords
2. **Secure Storage**: Passwords are stored in Firestore (consider encryption for production)
3. **Responsible Use**: Passwords should only be accessed by authorized personnel
4. **User Privacy**: Inform users about password storage practices

### How It Works

1. **User Creation**: When creating a new teacher or student, the password is:
   - Used to create the Firebase Authentication account
   - Stored in Firestore for admin reference
   - Displayed in the admin panel

2. **Password Visibility**: 
   - Passwords are hidden by default
   - Admins can toggle visibility per user
   - Copy function allows easy sharing with users

### Best Practices

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Encourage users to change their passwords after first login
2. **Secure Communication**: Share passwords through secure channels
3. **Regular Updates**: Consider implementing password reset functionality
4. **Access Logging**: Monitor who accesses password information

### Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- Password encryption in Firestore
- Temporary password links
- Forced password reset on first login
- Password generation with complexity requirements
- Audit logging for password access

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added password field to User interface
- `src/app/api/users/create/route.ts` - Store password in Firestore
- `src/components/admin/TeacherManager.tsx` - Added password display
- `src/components/admin/StudentManager.tsx` - Added password display
- `firestore.rules` - Updated security rules

### Security Rules
Firestore rules ensure only authenticated users can read user documents, maintaining the existing security model while allowing password storage for admin purposes.
